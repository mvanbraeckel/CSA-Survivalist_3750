# Final Document #

## Section A ##

* Included a few of Bio, Exec Summ, Groups, Personas, Cases, Req's, etc

It's reasonable to include the team bio in the main doc instead of an appendix.

Good exec summary, problem statement proposed solution are clear.

Again, at least an overview of the use cases mentioned could be included in the main doc.

Mention of the implementation, etc belongs in Section C.

I appreciate the cross reference links

More discussion on each group of requirements would have been better. It is good that the break-down is described, but a missed opportunity to really get into how your group decomposed the problem.

* Changelog requesting a remark?

Yes, but your group already got full marks on C1 and C2.

## Section B ##

* Reviewed paper protos & session?

Excellent background on the different parts of the prototype and overall UI design. Includes actual discussion and analysis.

* Photos?

Yes and they were used effectively. 

* Had some useful discussion on session findings?

Groups often have trouble with this section of the report, but your groups is one of the strongest I've seen. This is exactly what I wanted, very well done.

## Section C ##

* Described remote work strat?

Yes, thorough.

* Infrastructure description?

Yes, parts described well and strong insight shown in recognizing short-comings.

* Described design?

The flow-charts are good, it might have been more effective if you provided a preamble for each one. In formal documents like this, descriptions in text almost always precede the diagrams, figures, etc. You did this with the data flow diagram.

You conclusion on SSO is not quite right. You could have implemented this by making performing a secure LDAP bind against the directory with the user you want to authenticate. This is how logins for SOCS services are now handled.

* Code submitted?

Yes.
