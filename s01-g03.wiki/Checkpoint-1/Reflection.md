# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

### Reflection

As this was a brainstorming session, we wrote down every idea that we came up with regardless of how difficult the task could be. This "blue-sky" brainstorming generated a large number of ideas, many of which are a bit too ambitious for our scope. We will likely discard many of these stretch goals as a consequence of scope and time frame. For instance, our most ambitious idea VR/AR, will likely not come to fruition. Unfortunately, this means that our state-of-the-art map features will also get scrapped. However, this doesn't include the possibility of discovering other interesting features during implementation. Regardless, our team will strive to develop the project in an iterative and Agile fashion. To begin, we will start with the core features to create an MVP, and only after clearing each milestone we will proceed to focus on the next feature. As we create our product, we will make modifications and improvements as needed since both scope and requirements may change during development.

# Project Management Tools, Technology and Stack

> Specific Identification of Technologies for Content Management of the Product Itself

### Project Management Tools

We will work using Google Drive for concurrent editing purposes until we slowly migrate this functionality to the VS Code extension [Live Share]. The repository will be kept under the school assigned GitLab and university associated accounts. We will use a Slack group as our primary means of communication and to organize in-person meetings. Finally, we will be working with Trello as our primary tool for project management to help us keep track of epics and user stories.

### Technology Stack

After weighing which languages the team knows that best complement the project and with consideration of each member's strengths and weaknesses, we have concluded how we will approach the design solution. It will be developed as a single-page app (SPA) built in React with a JavaScript backend. React will be an easy way to create a solid user interface for both browser and mobile development because it is a framework that some of our team members are familiar with. Other options for a backend would be Java or C; however, something like Python, C++, or C# could be used as well. Once we acquire more detailed information and requirements, we will select the best tool for the job, integrating multiple solutions if necessary.
