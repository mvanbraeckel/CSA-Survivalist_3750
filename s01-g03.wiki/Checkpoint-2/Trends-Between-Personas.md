This page is a summary of our findings after analyzing every persona, and what they are looking for in this application. It also goes into how the scope of our project changed after these factors were taken into consideration.

# Trends Between Personas

### Trends

All of the personas we chose reflect a unique person that may use our application. These personas were meant to represent as much of the university population as possible, where they have a unique issue that needs to be solved by using our application. As we went on, we noticed certain patterns and trends emerge between users. These trends are what we will focus on delivering before building more niche and fringe cases, and will dictate what to prioritize.

First of all, most students who would need the information in this app are probably first year students in their undergrad. This means that many users of our application will need to use the core feature set, including the calendar, notifications for events, and general information about the university. This also includes prospective students, as they may also want basic information to know if they should apply, or if they want to prepare for their first day of classes. In either case, we need to be able to deliver a product that can allow people to get a grasp of all the important aspects of the university.

We also noticed that there is a subset of users where English is not their first language. Although currently most students are from Ontario, there are still some people who are from other countries. As the University expands, we also have to take into account that foreign students are more likely to become part of the campus life, so we need to provide them with the same information that native speakers have. This means that once our core features are developed, we should provide a way to translate our pages into their language of choice. This also applies to people with disabilities, since an entire user group needs features such as a text reader.

We cannot assume that each user is familiar with technology, so we need to make sure our application is intuitive to use for those that havenâ€™t had as much experience with mobile applications. However, we also need to make sure that there are still some features that people who are more familiar with technology require, such as those managing certain pages, or people who moderate the whole application.

### Conclusion

The scope of the project has not really changed after considering these user stories because we took these into account when creating the ideas for our application. We will develop our core features first, and then focus on more niche requirements to satisfy every potential user. If we cannot complete the more complex tasks, at least we will have the core feature set that we know every user will use. This means focusing on the calendar, notification system and map. Due to a large subset of our users potentially not being familiar with English, we should focus on getting more language support before other accessibility features. Finally, we will focus on providing moderators of the app a way to do their job in an efficient manner.
