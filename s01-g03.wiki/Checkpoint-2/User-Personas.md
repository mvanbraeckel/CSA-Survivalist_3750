### Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

- **Persona**: Average Student
- **Age**: 18
- **Origin**: Canada
- **Marital Status**: In a Relationship
- **Education Level**: Undergrad (First Year)

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Bob is an undergraduate student doing his Bachelor of Science in Physics. He’s an active student who plays sports, participates in events, and works at No Frills. He wants to maintain a healthy living and is keen on discovering healthy food options. Bob has trouble remembering where his classrooms are and finds it difficult to find the best study places because he prefers quiet study areas.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

Bob is meant to represent the general user of our application. We know it’s difficult to find classrooms, restaurants, and events. In order to pay for rent and books, it is common to have a part-time job while studying full-time. We want to consider how Bob manages to juggle his work life, school life, and social life. His comfort with technology should represent the average population which means that he knows how to navigate a computer or phone.

## Lianna Booth

### Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

- **Persona**: Away From home
- **Age**: 18
- **Origin**: Alberta
- **Marital Status**: Single
- **Education Level**: Undergrad (First Year)
- **Occupation**: Unemployed
- **Comfort with Technology**: Normal

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Lianna is a first year student from Alberta and is pursuing an education in Veterinary Science. Unfortunately, none of Lianna’s friends from her high school in Alberta came to Guelph and she is finding it difficult to make friends. She doesn't want to disturb others during lectures and finding people who share her interests and hobbies is hard. As a result, she wants to become more involved in on and off-campus communities in order to feel more comfortable away from home and to make new friends.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

University is a major change in life that requires support from family and friends. It may be your first time living alone and your parents won't be able to look after you. Also, there are students who start university without any friends to support them or rely upon. Making friends in a completely new environment is hard and it is not easy. This is especially true for out-of-province or international students.

### Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

- **Persona**: Agricultural Student
- **Age**: 21
- **Origin**: Florida
- **Marital Status**: Married
- **Education Level**: Undergrad (Fourth Year)
- **Occupation**: Farmer
- **Comfort with Technology**: Low

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Dirr hails from a line of prestigious orange farmers in Florida and enrolled at Guelph for it’s amazing agricultural program. He is a hardworking student whose primary goal is to be the best orange farmer. To accomplish this goal, he spends time with his professors and always asks for advice about improving his work. He wants to be able to find contact information and look up building information so he knows who to go to when he needs information or help.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

The University of Guelph has a very large agricultural community, and this application we are developing would most likely be used by people who are in this type of program. We also chose this person to be from outside of Canada to better represent the international student demographic. We assigned a low tech comfort level, to show that we need to ensure our application is user friendly enough for people with less experience and exposure to technology in general. A marital status of ‘married’ was used here to show that it does not affect the users with respect to the app.

# Graduate Students

Current students of the University of Guelph typically pursuing postgraduate studies (e.g. MSc., PhD.)

## Casper Shad

### Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

- **Persona**: Student Perusing a Higher Education
- **Age**: 35
- **Origin**: Seychelles
- **Marital Status**: Married
- **Education Level**: Bachelor's Degree in English
- **Occupation**: Online Content Creator (Patreon Artist)
- **Comfort with Technology**: High

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Casper is a graduate student seeking higher education at the University of Guelph after a long hiatus doing freelance artistry. He has a passion for drawing and wants to meet other people who share a similar interest. He has been successful drawing specialist art pieces and he has saved enough to pursue an MBA with the hopes of going back to the 9-to-5 work schedule. Due to this very long break in his studies, he feels overwhelmed and wishes to show his art to his friends.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

We wanted to highlight the older demographic of students that attend university because they are a small but prominent subset of students. Although most students start university after high school, it is important to realize that students can pursue education at any time and we shouldn’t design an application that is solely aimed at one age group. Also, the application should be easy to use and streamlined in order to accommodate people who are busy with full-time jobs or other activities.

## Adalrich Schröder

### Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

- **Persona**: International Student
- **Age**: 24
- **Origin**: Germany
- **Marital Status**: Single
- **Education Level**: Bachelor's Degree, Pursuing a PhD in Psychology
- **Occupation**: Unemployed
- **Comfort with Technology**: High

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Adalrich is an international student from Germany who has a Bachelor in Psychology. He is pursuing a PhD in order to become a fully licensed therapist. He has a passion for helping others and is a big proponent of mental health. He chose the University of Guelph because he heard that Guelph has a large multicultural community. He has learned some English as a part of his transition to Canada, however, he is struggling to fully understand the language. He constantly complains that English is a mishmash of other languages and the grammar often makes no sense.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

We wanted to add a person who comes from a completely different culture. We need to be aware of the differences between cultures because we may make assumptions that are not universal. For example, we should describe actions using icons in order to minimize the language barrier. However, depending on the person, the same icon may mean different things. We need to pay careful attention to the design of the interface.

# Prospective Student

Potential students looking to research the University and its policies/customs

## Agatha Thornbrough

- **Age**: 17
- **Origin**: Canada
- **Marital Status**: Single

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Agatha is a student from northern Ontario and goes to a high-school that prides itself on being very environmentally conscious. Ever since she was young, she loved to help her father mow the front lawn and decided that managing fields is her calling in life. She was recently admitted to the Turfgrass Management program at the University of Guelph. Along with getting her feet wet as an OAC student, she also plans on being an avid night-club enthusiast. As a prospective student who has already enrolled and been accepted in the school, she wants to befriend other fellow turfgrass students and become the life of the party.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

We chose the education level of Agatha to be a newly graduated student from high school with her OSSD. Some users of this application may want to prepare and learn about the university before they move in on the first day. As a new student, being able to know where all of the important facilities are located is vital so that she doesn’t get lost going to her classes. Similarly to other users, she has a lower comfort with technology because we want to make sure our application is usable for everyone.

## Peter Picky

He is looking into universities to apply to and the University of Guelph is one of them. He would like to know what the culture, degree, and co-op program is like at the University of Guelph in comparison to other universities.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

We chose this demographic to represent the population of users who are looking to apply to the University of Guelph. This individual would want to learn about student life on campus in order to decide if the University of Guelph is a good fit. The application should provide information that is important to new students.

She wants other students to feel the passion that she had all those years ago. Sherry is a system administrator, having full control of the application, including but not limited to managing all user activity in the app, keeping information up to date, and managing notifications. She is a very prominent figure at the University of Guelph, specifically with the Computer Science students. As such, she has concerns about who can see her information and wants to make sure that it is secure.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

We wanted to have a person that is not only very comfortable with technology, but has been in the field for a long time as well. We needed someone to represent the administrator role of the application. We need to design the application with administrative controls in mind to allow for content management and standards compliance.

## Eddie Cruz

He has a passion for bringing people who are interested in gaming together. Eddie has special privileges in the application because he needs permissions to create pages for his club, notifications for upcoming events, and moderate any comments and chat channels related to his club.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

We want to acknowledge that the university has clubs and events that need to be advertised in order to bring in more members. As a result, our application should provide students with a means to discuss them. Eddie is a content moderator who has a high comfort level with technology. He should be able to use the complex features that are available in the application.

# Disabled Persons

- **Persona**: Visually Impaired User

### Description of Individual <!-- omit in toc -->

Joseph is a legally blind man who is in his third year of academic studies as a music student. He suffers from extreme nearsightedness and is also colour-blind. Joseph plays the piano and a variety of string instruments and uses his musical abilities to write his own pieces of music. Joseph carries a pair of high prescription glasses and a probing cane. Joseph will use the application to give him auditory reminders for his orchestra recitals and practices with his band.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

Most people using our application would be able to see the interface; however, not everyone has the same level of visual acuity and our application must reflect this. Everything else about the person is fairly standard for an undergraduate student other than their disability. Since they are visually impaired, they may not be as comfortable with technology that relies on sight.

Bob is an undergraduate student originally from California who transferred to Guelph to study Sociology. Bob was born with a disability that prevents him from using fine motor skills, but that doesn’t stop him from being a great student. Bob likes to meet new people and tell others about his story.

### Reason for Demographics <!-- omit in toc -->

Other personas navigate the app using touch, but some individuals are incapable of interacting in this manner. The application needs to accommodate users with disabilities by providing multiple input and output methods. We need to design the application to comply with accessibility standards.
