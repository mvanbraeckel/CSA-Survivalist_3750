- Mitchell had to explain what the newsfeed was and had to direct the user
- Not obvious to where to get access for notifications from home page (maybe change up names?) - she struggled with newsfeed vs calendar

### Feedback

- Use blank paper instead of writing censor
- Confused with user interface paradigms
- Not sure about the newsfeed term
- Group permission model was not what I was expecting but sort of made sense after thinking about it. It may be helpful to have a descriptor on the page, maybe a question mark that explains that concept so its clear.
- Use tooltips?
- Simple to use - good simple design
- Remove censor bar
- Change “Leave” to “Leave Group”
- Add text “Back” in addition to the left arrow
- Need to change the newsfeed name
