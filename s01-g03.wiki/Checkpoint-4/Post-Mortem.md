## Session Description

Each member of the group was assigned a role and was responsible for a specific task during the paper prototype session. Peter Hudel was the computer and his job was to manipulate the paper prototype to reflect and simulate the user's actions as they interacted with the mock interface. Mitchell Van Braeckel was the facilitator and his role was to explain to the user the purpose of this paper prototype session, to present tasks for the user to complete, and to answer any questions because he was the only one who was allowed to interact with the user. Jason Chow, Jason Nguyen, Dixant Patel, and Kenneth Chan were observers who were responsible for recording the user's actions, behaviour, and concerns.

We conducted usability testing on three users for this paper prototype session. The first user was Protim Roy, a 26 year old graduate student who is pursuing a master‚Äôs degree. His comfort level with technology is very high. He is representative of our graduate student personas which have high comfort levels with technology. Also, he voiced accessability concerns which is representative of our disabled persons personas. The second user was April Nejedly, she is 49 years old and has multiple post-graduate degrees. Her comfort level with technology is very low. She is a part of the graduate student persona population. The third user was Dana Rea, a 45 year old undergraduate student with a low comfort level with technology. He is representative of the undergraduate student persona that has a low comfort level with technology.

The paper prototype session started with the users going through the precondition of logging into the system using the University of Guelph‚Äôs (UoG) Single Sign On (SSO). When the user was logged in, they were directed to complete two use cases. The first use case was about creating a notification. The user would need to create a notification via two methods. One method was through the newsfeed and the second method was through the calendar. The second use case was about managing content as a content moderator for a group. The user was asked to edit a group page's information and to save their changes. When we were finished taking the user through the core paths, we would then explore or explain the alternative paths for the use case.

## Continue

The general consensus about the paper prototype session was that the paper prototype was very well done. Most of the time, all three users were able to navigate through the core path of each use case with very little direction from the facilitator. The facilitator simply provided basic tasks to complete and the user would understand the process required to complete it. Every user also commented about how the paper prototype session was organized and detailed. They enjoyed our explanations about the alternate paths that they could have taken, as well as the potential issues that we took into account. The facilitator clearly explained the goals and rules of this paper prototype session and the user was aware of what they were and were not able to do during the session. We are going to proceed with using this user interface for our final application but we still need to make a few small modifications. In general, the user interface passed our usability tests. We received comments about how the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù and ‚ÄúRemove‚Äù buttons when clicking on a notification were well designed. Specifically, the user April Nejedly, who had difficulty reading small text, appreciated how large the button text was, as it made it easier for her to read and interact with them.

## Start

Most of the feedback that we received was more about modifying existing functionality rather than about missing features. For example, we received feedback from every user that we should make certain elements of the user interface more intuitive. Every user had trouble with editing notifications on the newsfeed page. Our user interface wasn‚Äôt intuitive about where to click in order to edit a notification. As a result, we need to add something to make the process of editing a notification clear. This could be done by having a pencil icon, dropdown arrow, or some other way to indicate that the notification is editable. Finally, Dana Rea mentioned that tooltips or info (üõà) buttons can be used to provide instructions and information to the user. This feature would help users navigate and use the application's more complex features. Having such a feature would make it easier to use the application for people with a lower comfort level with technology and would allow us to make the user interface more intuitive.

## Stop

The paper prototype session revealed some issues that need to be fixed. First of all, every user was initially confused about the ‚Äúcensor bar‚Äù and the facilitator had to clarify that its only purpose was to hide user interface elements that the user could not interact with. If we were to redo this paper prototype session, we would remove the censor bar and replace it with a blank piece of paper. It would be more clear to users that it is not a part of the user interface and that its purpose is to hide stuff. We also received feedback that the ‚ÄúCreate Notification‚Äù popup on the calendar page was potentially intrusive. This popup would cover up existing events and prevent the user from seeing the parts of the calendar. Potential solutions could be moving this popup to either side of the screen and make the calendar move to the side or to allow the popup to be minimized or moved. Another issue that everyone had involved the use of the term ‚Äúnewsfeed‚Äù. At first, April Nejedly believed that the newsfeed was simply a ‚Äúfeed of news that [she] subscribed to‚Äù rather than a feed that showed notifications. Due to the name, it wasn‚Äôt immediately clear that the newsfeed allowed you to view and edit notifications, and we should revise it to something such as ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù or ‚Äúnotification feed‚Äù. Finally, April Nejedly was confused about the ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù button on the group page. The purpose of the button is to allow a user to leave a group that they are a part of. April Nejedly accidentally clicked on the ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù button when her actual intention was to exit the group page. We need to make the user interface more clear by renaming the button to ‚ÄúLeave Group‚Äù.
